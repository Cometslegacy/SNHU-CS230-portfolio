    #Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
      The software created for "The Gaming Room" was made so that they could play a web-based game called "Draw it or lose it". This required players to join team and play a game where pictures would be shown, and a team would have to guess what the picture was. 
    
    #What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
      I believe I did the user authentication very will in this application. Allowing different levels of permissions for each person that connected to the game.
    
    #What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
      Creating the UML diagram helped me visualize what needed to be done, and accomplish my task quickly and effectively.
    
    #If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      If I could chose one part to revise, I would pick my description of Mac clients/Servers. I have never used them before and would like more experience to allow for a wider depth of knowledge.
    
    #How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      Understanding what the client wants can be difficult at times. Reading things carefully and following directions exactly is the key to this. It is important because if you create something the user doesnt want, you have wasted time creating something that was never asked for.
    
    #How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
      I approched designing the software piece by pieece. Trying to take this challenge on all at once would be too much of a task, so breaking it into smaller peices helps me.
